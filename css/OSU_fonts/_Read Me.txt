Stratum 2 is our display font. It works best for headlines at 18 points or larger. All weights of the font are appropriate for use in headlines. Due to the geometric nature of the characters, the lighter weights of the font are recommended for uses smaller than 18 points.

Rufina Stencil is our serif font. It is best suited for headlines and subheads, and it should never be used for body copy. The gaps in its letterforms that characterize a stencil typeface make it a dynamic option for headlines, offering a clear contrast with Stratum 2 and Kievit Pro. Do not use Rufina Stencil at sizes smaller than 10 points.

Kievit Pro is our workhorse font. We can use it for smaller headlines, body copy and captions. It is a highly legible, cleanly constructed face that is suitable at sizes from 5 to 19 points.
